Very basic syntax highlighting and indentation rules for Chip8 assembly. These rules will apply to any *.8o file.

Statement keywords like save, load, sprite, etc. are not highlighted by default but can be included by uncommenting the following lines in syntax/8o.vim:
  hi def link chip8Functions  Function
  hi def link superChip8Functions  Function

I don&#039t have a lot of experience with Chip8 so if there are important rules that I missed or you have indentation problems please feel free to offer suggestions.
